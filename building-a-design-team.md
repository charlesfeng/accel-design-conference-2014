_There's so many roles now -- UX designer, interaction designer, visual designer. How do you hire?_

Peter: It's kind of like hiring for a basketball team, where you want a range of different skills and abilities. The one designer who can do everything is the mythical unicorn; when you're hiring for a team usually you'll have people with different strengths complementing each other.

_Do you differentiate between different sub-specialties of design?_

Peter: At Groupon we have two big categories: product designers and visual/communications designers. Within product we don't distinguish (whereas others can differentiate between visual and UX) -- but I think that overly specifying through job titles limits what people think they can do. We know that not every product designer is the same.

Mia: We have brand design and product design; plus two other groups: content strategy and user research. In product, we don't distinguish between visual/UI/UX designers; everyone has their own strengths though.

Shalin: The product experience team are "experience designers", typically generalists, though there are individuals stronger at user research, UI design, UX. We have content strategists and writers, plus branding/marketing people.

_Is UX dead as a term for designers?_

Mia: We stay away from having any titles with "UX" in it -- anything that touches product affects the user experience. Front-end engineers, designers, customer support all touch it.

Peter: We do the exact same thing at Groupon -- UX is everyone's responsibility. Giving someone the title of "UX" absolves others in the organization of responsibility.

_How do you source designers?_

Shalin: We got started a couple years too late. At that time, we were two designers doing the app, mobile, etc.; a tech focused company with no real emphasis or process with design. In scaling the design team at the pace that we needed, we realized that agency folks have really great process so we looked at them first; though the negative side is that there was the chance of too much process. But it's hard to instill process into a designer, much easier to strip it out.

Mia: Sourcing designers is hard and takes a lot of time. It doesn't really matter to us where you come from; at the core we want to find people who are great product thinkers, who love our product and see its potential. Having navigated the process before is great, but overall it's about great talent and great thinking. Our design team sits together in a room with a drink and talks about what has been done, whether they'd be a good fit for our team.

Peter: Designers are now getting "harassed" on LinkedIn -- the returns are diminishing on LinkedIn. One thing that has worked is to not have recruiters be the first touch, but designers themselves. For me, one of the most important things I've done the last 18 months was hire a set of design leaders, senior managers with 10-15 years experience, to create teams within the organization and figure out what they need to manage those teams. For recruiting, you will get a lot of rejections and non-replies, but sometimes you just break through. We've also given up sourcing from the Bay Area (everyone in the Bay Area has a job they like).

_How do you screen talent?_

Shalin: the top three things for me are curiosity, passion, and the ability to storytell. Everyone can pixel push, but the art of storytelling is a craft. Answer the whys, whats, and hows as part of the design process. Be curious about what's coming out in the forefront and get ahead of that wave. Passion is the kind of initiative they take: are they doing side projects, are they doing things beyond just web and mobile? When we bring someone in, the work is not the most important part -- we know the work is great -- it's culture fit, whether we can work 12-15 hours a day with them at Uber, go drinking with them.

Mia: The most important thing is the why: what problem they were trying to solve, what opportunity they saw, how the design was going to achieve that. We look for people who are excited about learning: not just new platform or new technologies, but how to improve their own work, continuing to make bigger and better things.

Peter: We would love to get more mid- and senior-level designers, but there are only so many of them and they're usually happy in whatever situation they're in. So we end up bringing in more junior-level folk just out of school. We'd love to hire diamonds, but diamonds in the rough are okay. Having strong designer leadership can help bring out the best from these new people.

_How do you onboard designers?_

Mia: Introduce them to several people throughout the organization, hook them up with a "culture buddy" who takes them to team events, to lunch; answer some of the questions that they're shy about asking. Let them know everything that's going on and find out what they're really excited about.

Shalin: Our onboarding process is a mess and something we're actively working on fixing. We have conversations going on how to empower to design team, what pain points they saw when they onboarded and how to fix them. We do make sure the new hires find out the pace we're moving and what's expected of them -- a balance between comfort and keeping them on their toes. We ask them to spend time online applying to be a driver to see what they think of the online experience. We are trying to plan a bootcamp now for new people.

_How do you get designers to work well and collaborate with others?_

Mia: There are two parts that are important for collaboration: (1) the ability to ask for, aggregate, and act on feedback; (2) partnering them with people who are going to help them grow and stretch their skills. This can be matching them with another designer, a PM who's a great product thinker, an engineer who's a great prototyper and UI designer. Look for opportunities to make them stronger and excel in their work.

_Tell me a bit more about your culture of critiques._

Mia: Developing a culture of critiques early is important as it challenges each designer to not take feedback personally and improve their work; and helps your designers create a common language for better communication in the future. One of our early mistakes was being too inclusive about critiques, but quickly we realized the room was too big to have a constructive critique. We love your opinion, but we're going to save this space for just product design. Keeping the space to a small conversation helped us be more productive.

_How do you keep designers happy and prevent them from going on to the next shiny thing?_

Shalin: We have tons of great problems we're solving for designers on the client side as well as the driver side. They have the ability to make an impact on people, and are continuously challenged not just from the work but also from the team itself.

Peter: Think of your design team as not just a team but a design community -- we call ourselves the Design Union at Groupon. Even when we're not working on the same problems, there's a great opportunity to learn from each other. Make sure you have that level of engagement on the design team; don't just embed designers in product teams where they're disconnected from each other. We also set up an education credit for coming to events like this, etc.

_How do you handle design and coding -- do your designers do some coding or are you partnering them with front-end coders?_

Peter: All of the above. Some of the designers we have are comfortable with coding and do their own front-end development; some are comfortable with fancy prototyping tools and can communicate their ideas effectively; others aren't ready for that yet and we encourage them to work with more experienced people to learn these skills.

Mia: We have exactly the same: all three.

Shalin: Same thing. Those who don't know how to code, we generally move them to some prototyping tool (even Keynote) just so they can bring it in front of users and see how they react to it.

_Could you talk a bit about your interviewing process?_

Peter: We do two phone screens; once they make it through that they go through an interview loop -- talking to designers, 1-2 product managers, one engineer -- to make sure they can engage functionally; have a presentation in front of the design team to evaluate their ability to communicate and tell stories, to be comfortable with and engage folks.

Mia: We try to keep our process pretty lean and short. We have an initial touch point before they come in -- over a beer, over the Phone or Skype. Then they come in and present their work to a small group of designers, then have one-on-ones where they go in depth on different topics.

Shalin: We hate long interview processes too. If the portfolio isn't strong enough or we have questions about it, we generally give them a homework assignment to see their process, whether they're thinking about the users, and how passionate they are (by the amount of time they spend on it, how deep they go into the research). We can also bring in a PM and an engineer to work with them on a problem for an hour, after which they present a solution. Afterwards, everyone gets in a room together and gives their yes's and no's; when there's a yes and a no we ask them to talk until one convinces the other.

Peter: References (especially backchannel references) are often useful to find out whether you'd work well with them. Don't borrow from engineering interview processes -- there often is a best answer to an engineering problem, but there is almost never a right answer to a hard design problem. Asking them to solve a hard problem in half an hour is going to bias you toward a designer you don't want.

_I'm a CEO who cares about design -- how would you recommend communicating with our designers?_

Peter: Don't just focus on what's in front of you but the goals and objectives you're trying to accomplish. Don't show the design initially; talk about the objective, the thought process, before giving design directions too early. Pull back a bit, be able to say "we're not focused on that, we're focused on the overall objective".

Mia: For a designer, being really clear about where they are in the process is really important. The most important thing we've done is coach our leadership team where we are in the process and what type of feedback is really valuable. When we're in the generative phase of a project, setting specific directions and making specific decisions may have a negative effect.
