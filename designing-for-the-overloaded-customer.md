Attuning ourselves to the consumer psyche will be important for building the billion-dollar businesses of the future.

_What's changed in all these years?_

Sarah: Biggest changes in expectations: a lot less tolerance for usability problems, a lot more expectations about visual polish and delightful moments.

Josh: At Twitter, the initial user was us -- we were building the product for ourselves. One of the biggest challenges we faced was that we weren't building it for us anymore; as the product and audience grew, it became glaringly apparent that we were serving not just one persona but hundreds. We had to do the hard work of understanding who the people were; their needs, behaviors, what they want to do, what they don't understand they can already do. Had to come up with strong archetypes that we could talk about.

Stewart: One of the things that stood out when I was in gaming was the importance of what was going on in the consumer's minds. Both times we didn't succeed at making games was because of the esoteric thing, it's not like any other game, if you have 45 minutes I'll explain it to you. Between 2001-02 and 2009, the biggest change was in the type of people who would play games and the corresponding shift in what was being created.

_How do you learn about the user behaviors, the user profiles? Do you build a lowest common denominator experience from the outset, or do you iterate as you go?_

Sarah: The audience is us, but I have a strong belief that the user is not like me. We know too much about the iterations that we've tried and failed. Lowest common denominator is way worse than starting with one audience (like Facebook did really well) and expand from there.

Josh: In the beginning for Twitter, there were such a diverse set of apps built on top in the third party ecosystem that allowed for expression of so many different needs. As the company started to want to control the experience of the product, they only then started to approach a baseline which they're still working on today.

_How do you design the onboarding process? What were some of the tradeoffs, what were some of the challenges and tensions you had to design for?_

Sarah: At LinkedIn, the goal was to get you connected with great opportunites that you were excited about. You needed a great network and a great profile. Facebook's tipping point was 7 connections in 10 days; Linkedin's was 30 connections in 30 days. Give users guided experiences but also immediate value and delight moments. Give them the flexibility to do it themselves and explore.

Stewart: We've invested the most thought, engineering, and design hours into the onboarding experience. We did a preview release annoncement in August, let the signups in slowly as an opportunity to figure it out. Twitter's huge advantage was keeping it 140 characters, a simple concept people could grasp and hang their hat on. Slack let people in, made a tweak, let more people in. When you use Dropbox, you as an individual make the decision on whether it's useful and whether you want to use it, but with Slack you have to deal with the idiosyncracies of every member of the team. When people are the first person on a messaging app and there's no one else on it, they want to send a message just to try it out -- we added a thing called Slackbot that asked you for your name shortly after you got on. Sending a couple messages and seeing what it looks like/how it works/how fast it was really fundamental to getting people on board. We have a tool to search message history; without any messages it's a completely useless product.

_Once you've onboarded someone, how do you get them to invest in your product? Tradeoff between hand-holding your user and letting them discover things on their own._

Josh: You want to take as wide an approach as you can, since if you just design one way in it's rough to force everyone through the same doors. There were a few things we found early on that made it really clear: folks coming on to find other people interested in the same things as them (sports, celebrities, etc); connecting people with their interests and their passions, plus people they knew. A lot of the onboarding flow was teasing this out of people -- we tried out a Hunch-like way of asking a few playful questions to get data to start your base experience. I think this is an underutilized way to get data today, especially on mobile. It's a beautiful marriage of doing all these things but also being taught how to use it at the same time. There's a strong emotional connection.

Sarah: The one other thing to consider is context: where did they come from? If they were coming from a Linkedin invitation, keep that person through the whole flow. You're going to be part of this person's community, and he's going to help you find jobs or whatever you're trying to do. If you're coming from a Google search, we show you the value proposition of how you came to us. For Wealthfront, we're a trust business and still kind of new, so our company philosophy is to deliver the entire product to you before you even give a username and password -- you answer a few questions, and we deliver you an itemized portfolio based on your risk preference. You can even take it and invest yourself.

_How do you know you've struck gold, landed on the specific feedback loop that will hook your users into the future? How do you know it isn't a false positive?_

Stewart: Everyone feels overwhelmed, everyone has information overload. The strange dynamic is, I'm wasting too much time on Facebook/Twitter, but I'm walking 20 feet to the bathroom and still pulling out my phone -- the mouse-pressing-lever behavior and habit that you want. When you have 30 seconds with nothing to do, and it's where you turn to look, that's the indication of success.

Josh: We had an extreme positive but we didn't see it at the time: DMs. When I'm engaging publicly, there's the chance I want to take some of it private, to bring it to people who I am closer with. We had only 3% engagement with DMs in our tests so we didn't pursue it then, but our tests in the last few years have proven there was really something there.

_Startups are getting extremely data-driven. There's data the engineers and PMs are paying attention to, but what are the specific important data points for designers?_

Sarah: We all care about the same data: engagement numbers, growth numbers, dropoff, time on page. That's the what; you have to dig in and understand the why. A great resource was our customer support team; those people have a wealth of information so go to their desk and chat with them.

Stewart: We have one number: daily active users -- logged in, opened the app, read at least one message. It's all or nothing; either the whole team is using the app or they're not. I try not to pay attention to MAUs or how many people sign up for Slack; on the other hand, customer support data (especially "can you please __") is important more than anything else. It's dangerous sometimes because you can't please everyone/do everything, but someone being compelled to take a moment out of their day to say something to you means it's something they really care about. I spend literally 6 hours a day on Twitter talking to people, reading feedback, reading what people want.

_Gamification -- are we past it, or is it an engagement pattern that is still somewhat relevant?_

Sarah: There's definitely a place for it, though we seem to be past that annoying trend. The progress meter has been a successful way of gamifying something, and it still works -- it marries business goals with what's good for the user. People don't have a high tolerance for very transparent gamification, but it has its place.

Stewart: Anytime you get a feature request about something you already have, that's a problem. Quip gives you three things you can do after you sign up.

_Flickr and Slack seem to have a sense of play -- how do you think about that?_

Stewart: There's a great book talking about how play is fundamental to our culture. You're entering an entirely different space in life; you're forgetting about the other things you're doing. We just put in a new loading screen on Slack that says "today is going to be a great day" which took 15 minutes but had the highest ROI of anything we've done. Part of it was stepping into a different space. It helps along that path of getting people to understand what they're doing -- they're crossing the threshold into that game.

_Building for today's consumer -- what's the single most important thing you should think about?_

Josh: Attention is valuable, so be very careful what you do with it.

Sarah: Have no fear.

Stewart: Clarity of purpose of the app is paramount; you have to understand what it is.
