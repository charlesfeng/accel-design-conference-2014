### Mobile App Design

_How do you think about moving from desktop to mobile? What do you keep in the mobile app?_

Soleio: Initially on mobile, had to deal with mobile latency, abstracting away application logic from desktop, etc. Launched some mobile-first features that had to address these issues. Later on, had to undo complexity, think back to first principles. Stepped away from a Swiss army knife approach to mobile dev (who knows what's in their swiss army knife anyway), build hunting knives instead of a multi-faceted gadget -> what if you were to build a cloud-based photo gallery app that was a container of all of your photos and memories?

Julie: On the desktop, Facebook became a portal to other applications/services/games. Many people have Facebook open all day in their browser, go do other stuff, then switch back. On mobile though, we want individual apps that are tools for their own purpose -- the phone itself is the Swiss army knife. Apps have a specific reason why you would open it and read it. Launched Paper this year, investing in Facebook Creative Labs -- suite of applications that are simpler, a lot more targeted.

_Both of your platforms started on desktop and moved to mobile. How do you bring a simple mobile app back to the desktop, to reverse it?_

Soleio: This isn't unique to Facebook or Dropbox; Instagram worked the same way. It's important to think about context: where does it sit inside your life? Mailbox focused on the mobile experience first, on iPhone first. Porting it to tablet, to Android, to desktop required recognizing that the contexts aren't quarantined from each other, and the best product experience should acknowledge that people move between the devices at different times. Let them compose long-form emails on mobile, then punt it to their desktop computer. Snooze not just based on time, but also based on location. How do you acknowledge the fact that people are moving across devices, and how do you capitalize based on what people do? What will be the next device -- a smartwatch, glasses, my car?

_When does someone use a regular feed, when does someone use a Paper-like gesture feed?_

Julie: We conceived of Paper when we acquired Push Pop Press, a really beautiful e-book on the iPad. We thought it was the future of where mobile was heading: very immersive stories, consuming content that's not just reading words, diving into an infographic/game/movie/sound clip. Don't just read, but play around and learn; have a choice how you choose to consume it. On mobile, we see many different types of rich media that we didn't see a long time ago -- amount of photos shared has skyrocketed; there are tools for putting photos together in a story, etc. The goal of Paper was to honor the content, not just now but where it will be. It's very challenging to force change upon people -- people are used to a certain way, a certain habit day-to-day; you'll be pissed if someone goes to your desk and rearranges everything. We couldn't suddenly release a new interface for Facebook, but Paper was a good way to test things out, experiment and learn from new things that are easier to do as a separate app.

_Let's talk about Android and iOS. What do you think of the differences between the two platforms?_

Julie: The Android market and how people use Android is still quite different from iOS. We've had a lot of time to optimize our iOS app and qualitatively the experience should be better on iOS, but our rating is higher on the Play Store -- expectations may be different between the two platforms. The long tail has significantly different expectations and needs: people on very old Android phones, small screens, and slow internet connections. There are also different patterns, e.g. it doesn't make sense to use a bottom tab bar on Android. We ask all our Android designers to use an Android as their primary device. We explore how to make designs a bit more responsive.

Soleio: Understand the core patterns of each environment, but don't use it as a crutch in determining what you think is the best experience on each platform. For Mailbox, the standard was a bottom tab bar but we didn't want to get in the way of reply to an email. We found that swiping a large part of your screen was easier than tapping a button, and so the Carousel experience ended up being quite similar between iOS and Android: swipe down to delete, swipe up to share. Use the platform pattern to do the thing that's native to the platform, but don't use it as a crutch especially if it stands in the way of a great user experience.

Ben: The flip side of breaking the convention is that you have to do a bit more user education.

_As your teams become more and more mobile, there are specific things you need to change in your process and tools. How did you adapt?_

Soleio: Early on, we conducted reviews in a conference room with a projector. We realized that the venue wasn't optimal (needed to be more collaborative), only one person was driving the experience (multi touch is physical, extremely tactile), everything looks good projected. Something that feels good on a one-time basis may not if it's used over a long time. It's hard to hold the state of a product that's under development in your head. We demo and test on the device itself; we built a templating system where you could print on a giant foam board so you could see the entire workflow. All of our interaction designers are extremely technical, and we have a culture emphasizing tool-building, streamlining the work and collecting feedback.

Julie: It's very hard to explain (and understand) how something is supposed to work with static screenshots. Being able to build out the transitions in the prototype and ahve people play with it helps to tell the story. Even more importantly, tools change what you think is possible with design. When you're starting out, you have an idea in your head and try to translate it into a mockup; when you're more experienced, you start using Photoshop to try things out, explore ideas. Photoshop, on the other hand, isn't as useful for mobile development -- investing in a tool that can be as close as possible to mimicking the end product (e.g. Quartz Composer) brings it another step forwards. We also have instructors teaching designers iOS programming, etc.

Soleio: Tools also help you to improve your process. When your ideas are cheap to produce, you can try stuff out, throw them out without being sentimental. There's less burden and cost for small tweaks. Through rapid iteration you arrive at excellence.

Julie: It's easy for a team to get a build to a certain place and then open it up to the rest of the company for dogfooding.

_Where is mobile going the next 2-3 years?_

Soleio: More and more devices are entering the market that are that much more sophisticated and cheaper to own, plus all the services that come with that. It's moving to better personalization -- however, there's still no identity or one personalized experience for each app. It's easy to underestimate how much curating the experience per user can improve their interaction with your product. We have tons of room to improve there. In Mailbox, can we figure out what people are more likely to archive, anticipate what people are going to do next?

Julie: Things that don't just think about the interface, the surface itself, but the person and their whole experience using it. Airbnb does an amazing job connecting the online with the offline. Uber and Lyft are making experiences certain and simple, addressing the uncertainty, giving you information on where the car is and the entire experience. We think about design less and less about the interface, more and more about the whole experience.
