Great data visualization is finding those nuggets of data that matter, then giving them purpose, to help people make a decision.

_What do you guys do?_

Patrik: I have two roles: (1) I'm in charge of how we're evolving, what steps we're talking, (2) Talking to people, telling them what we do and how we give them visualization superpowers.

Jeff: We're an enterprise software company helping people work more effectively with data. The experience is the lifeblood of our product, and so I work hand in hand with the VP of UX, but also coordinate between engineering, product, and design organizations.

_What's the difference in designing and designing for data?_

Jeff: Data is a first-class stakeholder. A lot of times you start to design a product without a good understanding of the data. For example, rapid prototyping in the context of data requires you to actually bring the data in and design based on it especially.

Patrik: In graphics design, we use data to create a message: colors, layouts, messaging to user. But we don't really trust the data -- we need to make sure it's clean, that we understand it. The next step is to make it actionable, to make tools to explore the data.

_Where do you draw influence?_

Jeff: Inspired by visualizations where you really get lost in the data. Many times we have a huge space of possibilities, lots of dimensions of data, and when you're approaching things using an analytic tool you have to worry about how you can communicate it effectively. How do you simplify the data so that you preserve the dimensions, both visually and on the things that let you interact with and explore the data? What really worked well for exploration was trying to understand the data ourselves; falling in love with it the right way and trying to figure out how to share that love.

Patrik: Previously people looked at slices when looking at brain data, but with devices like Microsoft Surface you can do volumetric rendering, can peel off layers and go deep, see what's inside.

_Is there something that didn't work out, that you learned from?_

Patrik: We saw a collection of sales data that had names, emails, phone numbers in the same fields, etc; nothing could really be drawn from the data. Having good habits in storing data makes it much easier.

Jeff: My favorite failure story was a failure in getting usage and adoption. My thesis work was doing collaborate data visualization, leveraging everyone's insights to be more effective than doing it alone. We launched it for some cool data to find collaboration, and no one used it except some visualization geeks. Why? Lessons learned: (1) it was below the fold, (2) it was extremely poorly integrated with the content (it would have done better if they were forced to pay), (3) there was little guidance in how to use it; it might have been more useful to start with a story, gamify it a bit to bring people into the experience, then see where people take it.

_What is your process around telling a story with data, and how do you end up with something that not only the nerds love?_

Jeff: It depends on the project and the other stakeholders. Sometimes there's already a goal, but regardless, have respect for the data but ask hard questions about the veracity of the data and where it came from -- engage in full-blown data exploration. How do I structure a visualization so it has a narrative, showing you how to use it as you step through it?

Patrik: Always give access to the data source, and allow people to add back to your story with annotations/extensions if they find anything that supports or hurts your story.

_What is the difference between visualization in academia and in industry?_

Patrik: Industry cares a lot less about using the right colors, the best way to show something.

Jeff: It's important to treat different/optimal ways of presenting data as a set of guidelines instead of as hard rules. Think about the context, think about the tools available out there. I realized I was spending a lot of time just getting the data ready and so we started seeing that as a challenge in its own right. How do we take data, transform it automatically?

_What will data visualization/storytelling look like in 10-20 years?_

Patrik: Everyone will have access to all of their data, every tool possible that can visualize that data. We'll talk about visualization a lot more as a society.

Jeff: There is going to be a lot more automation, a lot more recommendation/suggestion. How do we keep end users in control and properly empowered in that world? It's still very time consuming now to go out and collect data; the problem in the future will instead be which of the millions of data sets I would actually look at, would actually use to solve my problem.

_What's the most important thing to keep in mind when starting down the path of data viz?_

Jeff: It's important to do some basic education: Tufte's books, other books that can give you some practical knowledge (Stephen Few, Alberto Cairo, etc). Get some basic literacy around data, fundamental statistical concepts.

Patrik: Work with, play around with the data yourself.

_Building a dashboarding/reporting solution, how much should you drill down, how much is freeform vs. picking things on behalf of the user?_

Jeff: Understanding your users and their tasks, what information is necessary to make their decision, is still paramount.

_How do you build a data team?_

Jeff: Ask what tooling you need, whether you need tech that scales out, what kind of workloads, what kind of goals. It's really hard to hire in this space; anything you can do to make a skilled individual that much more effective would really help.

_What are your words of wisdom for people in the audience who love design but aren't that familiar with data viz?_

Jeff: Don't be scared; be receptive to constructive criticism. Start from basic principles and build an aesthetic along the way. Competent design is something most people are capable of if they dedicate themselves to it.

Patrik: There are many great tools that can guide you along the right path: how you use a chart, is it a good chart to use. Start with data you're familiar with.
