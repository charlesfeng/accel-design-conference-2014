_How do you guys think of discovery and how design plays a role in that?_

Andy: The first thing I think about is beauty as a feature. In the original ecommerce world we were selling other brands online, and it wasn't about the aesthetics, just the distribution. When you're building a brand online, it's not leveraging an offline brand's existing brand awareness, it's about creating a brand and its aesthetic. Your story is about the photography and the design. The second thing is about service as a funnel, developing a service experience with free shipping, 365 day returns. Now that we've grown to 1000 styles, it's about discovery within those styles. The job of discovery is so hard that we launched a separate company to do it.

Sahil: Each of our users does their own discovery, but we can help optimize conversion to payment. We have to think a lot about things like risk, not just what the simplest credit card form is.

_How do you guys think about the tension between showing people all you have to offer vs. showing the things they're interested in?_

Andy: Email's an extension of your website and mobile app that can showcase only one product. We designed both the website and email to deal with the paradox of choice.

_What about discovery on mobile specifically?_

Sam: We think of the use case first. A person wants to find a hotel immediately without searching through hundreds of options, and we think that curation is especially important for Hotel Tonight. We make the customer experience really simple, but we also think a lot about and gamify the interface for hotels -- they can set their inventory for the night in four clicks, and there's a whole interface for hotels to compete to be shown for users. Hotels are also categorized by use case, e.g. lux vs. crash pad.

_How heavily do you curate?_

Sam: We think about what will have the most impact on people's behavior. The #1 thing is obviously distance, either around them or around some specific place. But showing lux vs. crash pads: staying at hotels is an occasional thing, and it entirely depends on the occasion. We try to show the right variety: not too many hotels with similar experience that are really close to each other. Figure out how curation can be useful to people, and figure out the use case where you've found something you want but it's not the best place possible.

_What do you look at for context?_

Andy: For a long time, we thought that we got you into our hero product (pants), then you spread out and explored the other stuff we offered. We found that someone who came in and bought one thing would continue to buy one thing, but if they bought multiple things they'd buy multiple things in the future too. Having a place where people can find their fit and have a great human experience stimulated them to share as much data as possible, which ended up in a better online experience as well.

_How do you deal with the checkout experience?_

Sam: We have a "three taps and a swipe" system for booking -- geolocate, see hotels, tap to look at a hotel, tap and trace the "h" to confirm a booking. There's no going back after you've confirmed, and having to trace the "h" reduced the number of false bookings by adding a bit of friction.

Andy: When you're on the start and you add something to your cart, we found that having the checkout window slide in partway prevented the problem of suddenly looking at the price of everything together in your cart. We also optimized our checkout pages -- it's not the landing pages but the end of the process where you can have the most lift. There's a balance we're trying to find between maintaining the shopping experience and needing to checkout.

_How have high-res images, product display, etc. affected conversion?_

Sam: Merchandising is particularly important for hotels, and we have a beautiful app, the best photography, and beautiful experience. User-generated content is also important; we have "snap or stay" which engages people to take pictures of particular areas of the hotel which we post on our feed, Twitter, etc. Keeps people engaged, makes people say "I really want to stay here", etc.

_What about product presentation are driving conversion, and what is just cluttering the way?_

Andy: You can't be a designer at our company if you don't control the photography experience as well. For Ayr, we've totally decluttered product pages and photography is a huge investment. One of the coming challenges for a designer is that if you're interacting with physical goods, you have to have control over more of the experience than just design; you're also going to be a creative director. The 80/20 on conversion is more on the photography piece than figuring out the next step of optimization for discovery.

Sahil: The thing about digital is that it's so easy to upload stuff, there's no friction involved. You want to encourage them to put in a bit more effort. The other component is context -- if you're coming from a specific experience (e.g. email/Twitter/Instagram), it should feel different. The seller is the creator of the experience, not Gumroad. It's similar to having differences in your app between iOS and Android.

_Desktop vs. mobile_

Andy: Scrolling is an ingrained behavior on mobile so there's pressure to push people downwards, but on desktop you want to keep things above the fold. How do you include enough info above the fold to help someone make a purchase decision, but enough interesting stuff below when they scroll? When do you stop showing inventory so you don't get diminishing returns from scrolling?

Sam: We do limit the number of options they have, focusing on giving the variety of options they expect on one page. Beyond that, every screen we have doesn't scroll; we're more focused on showing the right experience at the right time. We display a very small proportion of our inventory.

_Is there anything you've tried on mobile that didn't work?_

Andy: We wrestled with the number of categories in Browse; the layout of groups and subgroups; the granularity. The more you have, the faster you can get to the products you want, but the less discovery there is. In mobile, the big segmentation is between tablet and phone; on tablet, conversion is similar to desktop, but on mobile, people don't want to enter their credit card info. It's good for repeat business but bad for new customer conversion. A big unsolved question for us is how you can get your first purchase on mobile.

Sam: The one-click experience is great, but it's not really one-click for a new user. How do you onboard your users quickly and seamlessly? We've tried things like not requiring registration until booking; super easy registration process with e.g. auto-complete on email addresses (most of our users are still using actual email addresses instead of Facebook/Google+); use technologies like cardio that make entering credit cards easier.
