### Designing for the Enterprise

**Karen Cross, Design Manager, Atlassian**

Our fundamental vision isn't just to get people to buy products; it's to make our products so useful for our customers that they actually come to us.

At the end of the day, it's all about people.  
People in a work environment are different from people in regular life.  
Scale empathy across your organization.

_What's the fundamental element of people?_ In their personal life, people want to feel good, be happy, feel connected with family and friends. In their professional life, they want to feel successful, feel smart, look good in front of their peers and bosses. They have good days and bad days, and getting a sense of those emotions is really important as a designer.

_Talk to your customers!_ Go out there, do site visits, do contextual interviews. The problem with enterprise is that people are very guarded -- you never want to show fear and nervousness, never want to talk about your problems. Get people to start showing their emotions; ask why they're using your products in the first place -- did they have no choice? Was it the best tool? Take those motivations and base your design on them.

_What outcomes are we trying to achieve, what data do we have about behavior?_ Qualitative and quantitative data are two parts of one whole. The quantitative data can help you identify whether something is a real trend or not, can help you find really quirky small things around which you can form hypotheses.

Combine qualitative and quantitative and visualize what you learn. Take the abstract, vague concepts in people's heads and make them tangible so others can poke holes in it, shape it, make it better.

We use detailed _user personas_ and try to make them part of everyday conversation everyone's having. We put pictures of these personas on walls, in bathrooms, etc.

_What about people in the workforce?_ How is designing for enterprise different from designing for consumer? In enterprise, you often have to design for the 100% -- purchase decisions are still often based on a feature checklist; if you don't have something the person will walk. You as a designer are often faced with the challenge of designing for everybody at all times.

Our @mentions in Confluence are really popular, but really popular in different walled gardens. Some companies who have used it for years don't even know it exists, but you can't tell them 50 tips and tricks all at once or it'll be overwhelming.

_Design for flexibility._ You're in the product business; you need a one-size-fits-all solution when business want a custom solution. Design flexibility into your products (e.g. workflows in JIRA).

_Enable your design to scale._ In enterprise, the products you're designing are incredibly complex: you'll have tons of dialogs, inline messages, navigation problems. If you have to reinvent the wheel every time, you'll never get anywhere. As a result, you need a style guide and a component library. Encourage your designers to use standard components, but it's not inflexible -- document the standard set you have and have each designer try them first; but if it doesn't satisfy their need and they can convince you so, they can go ahead and design their own thing.

_How do you have empathy at scale?_ How do you have everyone in your company feeling that empathy for the end users of your products? Build a playbook like a sports team -- have a bunch of plays used for different circumstances. Is it a big project or a little one, is it a tight timeframe or not, are there a lot of concerns about this?

We've developed a fully-fledged playbook to solve specific situations: purpose, use this play so that __, who should be involved, allstars at the play, best practice examples.

All developers rotate for 4-6 weeks on the customer support team. He's answering emails, doing all the support stuff. As part of this, he's learning what customers are asking again and again, what troubles they're having, and can bring this info back to the product team.

_Dogfood your products extensively_. Everyone uses our products as a new user and documents the process extensively. What were they really confused about, where did they have to get help? As a side effect, everyone quickly becomes a power user.

At the end of the day, design is about people and understanding those feelings and emotions. Help them feel effective and smart in the workplace, and scale the understanding that you've gained throughout your organization.

Why does designing for the enterprise suck? The previous status quo of the enterprise has IT making decisions instead of the users; long-term decisions being made that inhibit innovation (focusing on the upsell instead of daily actives etc); still limited support for newer technologies (Chrome? Safari?). Of course, the response of the design community is invariably NO.

Why is it important? The majority of people's computer time is interacting with an enterprise product, and their success at their job is often directly proportional to how good they are at using the technology. Why can't you go faster, why can't you change the screen faster? The traditional adoption curve and sales process is also changing -- you no longer have to go through the IT department, take executives to golf, etc; there are all sorts of cool things you can deploy and get going.

Who are we? RelateIQ is focused on better relationships through smarter decisions. We want to put all this power of relationship management in a really easy-to-use form factor, helping you be more effective.

Address book -> On-premise CRM -> Cloud CRM (Salesforce) -> Relationship intelligence (what are we doing with all this data?)

It's important to solve this problem today because 99.999..% of a professional world's livelihood depends on a transaction, and the foundation of every transaction is the relationship. The more effective and agile you are with that, the better off you'll be at progressing your career.

Managing relationships using today's software is brutal. Most of the world still lives in spreadsheets -- how are you tracking your designers, your applicants? Usually people use a spreadsheet, a word document. The documents are always out of date because people have to manually enter data, and mobile is a far afterthought. The software actually impedes collaboration instead of fostering it.

We spend a lot of time designing so you can connect your accounts, take your relationships, and get going right away. How do we reduce the amount of time it takes to solve someone's problem? We also design so ours users don't make mistakes sharing their data in ways they didn't think will happen. The goal is to not make it it painful to use.

The design principles we use on every page are different depending on what information we want to show, what we want our users to do. We have a giant spreadsheet view to optimize for speed and efficiency, to be able to go through it very fast. We also wanted everything that's possible on the web to also be possible on mobile. It doesn't necessarily give you exactly the data, but gives you something that's useful -- e.g. signal bars to show importance.

We want to build things people love. It's about compassion, not just empathy.

What would a superpower be for a user in your case? What is the superpower you're trying to create? We focus on augmentation over relacement -- we're not going to take the position of arrogance, thinking we understand your best course of action here; we're going to just help you deal with the situation you're in. Data presented in the right way at the right time helps you make the best decision and accomplish what you want.

Create a sustainable design and product process. Turn principles into practice.

Hierarchy of needs: site up -> bug free -> functionally correct (does it do what you expected) -> feature correct (does it really solve your problem) -> user delight (did you love doing it?)

You can't fix what you can't measure. Measure like you're a consumer product: DAU, WAU, funnels and flows.

Are you design driven or data driven? It's a false argument -- use the data to course correct, but don't listen to it blindly. Look for the aspect where you can be aspirational, where you can go greater.
