### Designing for the Enterprise

**DJ Patil, VP of Product, RelateIQ; Karen Cross, Design Manager, Atlassian**

Why does designing for the enterprise suck? The previous status quo of the enterprise has IT making decisions instead of the users; long-term decisions being made that inhibit innovation (focusing on the upsell instead of daily actives etc); still limited support for newer technologies (Chrome? Safari?). Of course, the response of the design community is invariably NO.

Why is it important? The majority of people's computer time is interacting with an enterprise product, and their success at their job is often directly proportional to how good they are at using the technology. Why can't you go faster, why can't you change the screen faster? The traditional adoption curve and sales process is also changing -- you no longer have to go through the IT department, take executives to golf, etc; there are all sorts of cool things you can deploy and get going.

Who are we? RelateIQ is focused on better relationships through smarter decisions. We want to put all this power of relationship management in a really easy-to-use form factor, helping you be more effective.

Address book -> On-premise CRM -> Cloud CRM (Salesforce) -> Relationship intelligence (what are we doing with all this data?)

It's important to solve this problem today because 99.999..% of a professional world's livelihood depends on a transaction, and the foundation of every transaction is the relationship. The more effective and agile you are with that, the better off you'll be at progressing your career.

Managing relationships using today's software is brutal. Most of the world still lives in spreadsheets -- how are you tracking your designers, your applicants? Usually people use a spreadsheet, a word document. The documents are always out of date because people have to manually enter data, and mobile is a far afterthought. The software actually impedes collaboration instead of fostering it.

We spend a lot of time designing so you can connect your accounts, take your relationships, and get going right away. How do we reduce the amount of time it takes to solve someone's problem? We also design so ours users don't make mistakes sharing their data in ways they didn't think will happen. The goal is to not make it it painful to use.

The design principles we use on every page are different depending on what information we want to show, what we want our users to do. We have a giant spreadsheet view to optimize for speed and efficiency, to be able to go through it very fast. We also wanted everything that's possible on the web to also be possible on mobile. It doesn't necessarily give you exactly the data, but gives you something that's useful -- e.g. signal bars to show importance.

We want to build things people love. It's about compassion, not just empathy.

What would a superpower be for a user in your case? What is the superpower you're trying to create? We focus on augmentation over relacement -- we're not going to take the position of arrogance, thinking we understand your best course of action here; we're going to just help you deal with the situation you're in. Data presented in the right way at the right time helps you make the best decision and accomplish what you want.

Create a sustainable design and product process. Turn principles into practice.

Hierarchy of needs: site up -> bug free -> functionally correct (does it do what you expected) -> feature correct (does it really solve your problem) -> user delight (did you love doing it?)

You can't fix what you can't measure. Measure like you're a consumer product: DAU, WAU, funnels and flows.

Are you design driven or data driven? It's a false argument -- use the data to course correct, but don't listen to it blindly. Look for the aspect where you can be aspirational, where you can go greater.
