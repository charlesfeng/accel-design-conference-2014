_Why the hell do we need PMs in the first place?_

Amanda: I don't believe we need PMs on every team, but I believe we need someone who is on the side of the user and understands the vision of the company. It's a matter of having all the responsibilities and functions covered on the team. No one on the organization should be called UX because everyone is responsible for user experience, but ultimately there should be a decision maker on the team.

Anthony: Squarespace is modeled after how it grew up -- I ran it alone for 5 years doing all the design and engineering. I'm very used to interfacing with people who are the "makers": the designers/engineers themselves. It's not that we don't have anyone who thinks about product; I want the makers to think about product and own the roadmap. As things go, sometimes designers/engineers will need some help, need to collect data from customers, at which point they bring people on board to do it.

_The most common place friction comes from is that all three want some role in product direction. How do you make everyone feel enough part of the process without have to design/develop by committee?_

Arianna: That's really challenging for both small and large groups. It comes down to transparency and roles/responsibilities, which sometimes in this world of overlapping circles is murky. You have to be clear, assign roles/responsibilities, give people as much info as they need to be successful at their task, making sure they're committed and understand what they're working on.

_What are some concrete things they can do to create that kind of communication?_

Arianna: I like war rooms even though that kind of space is uncomfortable: dedicated spaces where we're showing everything, the entire Z axis of my thought process. Engineers and designers present their work in the war room, get up and talk about it -- oftentimes they have moments where they realize what they thought was going to happen isn't going to happen.

_As you guys have grown the company, Anthony, how do you make sure people feel as involved as necessary?_

Anthony: We're 280 people, half of which are customer care. Now we have so much better building blocks for the engineers to use that there's not as much guesswork when we're putting things up. Our engineers also have an appreciation for design and tend to get involved right away. Getting people with the right kind of alignment, who want to make the right kind of products, has gotten rid of that kind of friction. The worst kind of friction is when the engineering and design teams sit apart -- the more they're iterating together, the more frequently the cycles happen, remain a continuous, smooth thing.

_Do you have any thoughts on the physical design of spaces that encourage better interaction between teams in an organization?_

Amanda: One of the things we've seen that works really well is having the teams co-located. It's really frustrating for a PM to track people down in an organization; even with daily scrums, life happens outside so co-located teams is best for rapid iteration. How do you keep holistic development, deal with tech debt? Once a week ("Wow Friday") designers and PMs get together and work on holistic roadmaps, new insights, look at what new competitors are doing, etc. We have a full design room as well as full teams, so most people have two desks.

_Designers aren't always the nicest people in the world. How do you create a perfect democracy within your organization, or is having democracy even a laudable goal?_

Arianna: It comes down to personal relationships and trust that are created over time. Sometimes you have instant chemistry or instant repulsion; you have to find ways to bridge and come around that. We dealt with some major issues by sitting together in a war room, doing research together, letting go of our titles to have a constructive, friendly dialogue.

_We rarely talk about soft skills in design, which turns out to be 70% of the job. Do you have any tricks for designers entering a team to build that trust with people?_

Anthony: We like the one designer-one engineer configuration a lot; just putting their heads together and seeing what floats to the top. A lot of big things were accomplished by two people including the commerce platform. This was possible because a lot of things are already in place and standards were already set.

_What kind of scale have you seen in team size?_

Amanda: We've found that 5-7 people is optimal -- nearly every team has a full-time designer, PM, researcher, and a few devs. If it's two people, we'd give them a larger piece of the problem so they're not optimizing locally and ignoring the big picture.

_People within teams (designers especially) come up with their own ideas about where the product should go. But most designers lack the skills to get something on the roadmap. What techniques have you seen designers use to get over these hurdles?_

Arianna: Show, don't tell. Take the extra time, prototype it, sketch it out, and have a meaningful conversation about what you're thinking. Do as much as you can do to actualize the thought.

Anthony: Have everyone understand the full roadmap and keep your teams very small so you have a better understanding of the capacity of the engineers you'er working with. Watch out for requesting too much -- the more a designer understands how quickly something can be developed, the better.

Amanda: Ask how something can solve a problem for the user instead of just how it looks better. Invoke the user. Knowing your space, your users, the problems you're solving gives credibility.

Arianna: It's incredibly valuable to map your ideas to contexts that are relevant to the business, to avoid having ideas that are purely cosmetic changes.

Anthony: We have a bias toward individuals being able to do tons of stuff. Do the user research, understand what the users want, make it look good, make it fit, understand what you can't do -- make sure you're aligned with your strengths. Sometimes it's incredibly helpful to not draw lines between roles -- people can surprise you with the insights they have.

_How do you drive roadmap and prioritization? Is it just top down?_

Amanda: Top down roadmaps suck. It results in a lack of belief or buy-in in how you came up with these decisions. Get feasibility, usability, value, assumptions, risks sorted out with your team -- they'll believe it and feel accountable for it.

Anthony: A hybrid works for us -- I run a lot of product but I'm also an engineer, and I try to stay involved at both the lowest and highest levels of the organization. The people who are the doers are so close to me that I get a really intuitive feel for what we can accomplish, what the biggest roadmap items are in people's minds. A lot of my job is to make sure the best ideas float to the top, throw out ideas that are great but not really great, get rid of distractions, make sure people focus on the parts they care about.

_There's tension between designers/engineers/PMs on generating of ideas, but there's also tension in that each team knows its own constraints but no one else's. How do they educate each other to prevent asking for impossible things?_

Anthony: Both sides have to admit that neither is possible without the other. There's a mutual respect that develops from working really closely with one another.

_How do you improve efficiency?_

Arianna: 95% of the time we're not doing needless things -- usually the trouble is bad time management, false inputs, unclear direction. It's rare to find a designer who's just designing something for the sake of it. Information is important for the designer: what is the task, what are the constraints, what does the engineering team need, what do the users need? Have an obsessive curiosity about things in front of you. Having multiple projects simultaneously can help with efficiency as you wait for information to arrive.

_In startups, we're driving with our foot all the way on the gas. This constricts the ideation phase for new products. Have you seen strategies that work where PMs, designers, and eng can work together on new ideas that fit in the time schedule for a startup?_

Amanda: Accept that no one moves fast enough. Constraints can create better outcomes, eliminate feature bloat. PMs and designers are asked to work 1-2 weeks ahead of development, since dev is the most expensive line item. Work smarter, make the right bets. Nothing is done at release; nothing is worse than releasing and walking away to the next idea. Release is like the 3rd inning; you need to stick it through.

Anthony: A big thing for us is throwing out good ideas and being in the discipline of doing that all the time.

_Isn't part of design's role to make tangible a seemingly impossible future, and seduce us into its inevitability?_

Arianna: Yes! But that's design with a capital D, in its most pure form. It has a lot of other duties too.

_Is there a way to do that in a startup?_

Arianna: I haven't practice this but I've heard about it. Designers hate agile and say there's no room for thinking -- it's good for really lean ideas but doesn't have the open-head process to sit down and ideate. But in agile methology, there's an inception phase that's way before the sprint cadence -- that's the piece that most people are missing. Until we understand what we're doing, particularly on the design side of things, we need to get into the rhythm to get a head start.

Anthony: Some of the worst things that happen that come from a lack of clarity is opening up a code editor/Photoshop and starting to code/design, without understanding what you're doing.

_Does design drive the long term vision of Squarespace?_

Anthony: Squarespace is a creative tools company. Our customers come with ideas without the ability make websites, and with us they're able to put those ideas online and have them seen by the world. How it looks and how it's presented matter. The website's the clothing you're wearing, and if you change it you make an impression on people and how your ideas are presented.

_Tell the other two disciplines what people should really know about your discipline._

Arianna: I think engineers and PMs need to know that designers are problem solvers, and need the problem identified for them. They don't need a particular solution, they need a problem statement and roles.

Amanda: At the end of the day, PMs are trying to advocate for the user. Solving user problems solves the business problems. I love impossible design, architectural changes and tech debt; just explain things to each other.

Anthony: It's important to realize that engineering is a creative process; at any point you have a million routes you can take. Have respect for an engineer's creative process in the way you want them to respect your creative process -- sometimes there's fits and stops, sometimes you have to start again at the beginning. A designer/PM who doesn't understand might come up with something slightly different that takes 10x longer -- be sure to take in as much knowledge as possible.
