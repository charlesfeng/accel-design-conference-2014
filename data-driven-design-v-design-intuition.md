_Let's start talking about data and instinct, how you use those in your jobs and what they mean to you._

Brynn: I thought a lot of my design was based on instinct and gut feelings, but that actually came from the research work I did before. Recently had to deal with a decision between following the style guide (data) vs. making a call to action much bolder (instinct). It's a lot harder to un-launch and retract/revise when it's live. Use data continuously over the course of your project.

Bradford: What was most important was combining them well to make a good experience. If you think it feels wrong/too complicated, you're probably right, but it's hard to go from that to what you might try to make it smoother. Prioritize your ideas as to what to try by collecting and using information -- but make sure it's the right data.

David: In my experience, the way we use data is trying to find the pain points -- what's not quite right here, why are we losing a lot of users here? Can also be used to validate designs -- is it accomplishing what we're trying to do? We tend to use it before and after, as inspiration and as validation.

_How do you trust your instinct when you have such hard, crisp data?_

David: Maybe data and instinct aren't so much separated. No data is actually neutral -- it's measured and presented by a human, both of which aren't as objective as they seem. Maybe instinct isn't as subjective as it should be, as it's also relying on your own series of experiences. Picasso's painting took him a lifetime + 5 minutes.

_How do you know what to pay attention to in this middle ground?_

Bradford: Be explicit about your assumptions. Instinct should always be backed by some form of reasoning; it doesn't have to be highly quantifiable but should be there. If it's just an assumption or a guess, also be clear about that. When you go through these cycles where you want to debug a problem with a product (e.g. dropping half of people at that step), it's not really telling you what you should do to solve it; it's just telling you that people are dropping off. At that point you need to find finer-grained details: are people misclicking? Setting up an experiment and talking to customers is often beneficial at this point. Make good design decisions at each step; sometimes it might require metrics or a user story, but sometimes it's just making a good guess.

Brynn: If you know your app is going to be invoking new behavior and new trends but you get a lot of boos, you have to think about what your goals are: if you're entering a new space, you might just run with your instinct and look back at it later; if you're trying to improve your current flow, you could lean more on data to see what could be changed today.

David: Data is important for the design process, but so are qualitative things in user tests: when they're struggling, when they're smiling, etc. Data provides a look at present and past, but instinct helps you think about the future. Finding the right balance between these things is most important.

_How often do you run user tests?_

David: We do a lot every day, have an entire team doing it. Designers, product managers, etc all use user tests. There's nothing better if you want to be close to your user.

Bradford: We've overinvested in a lot of user studies in the past that weren't super valuable, out of sync with what we were working on at the time. They were too broad -- the old-school UX style, 3 months persona research. Think about the design problems you're trying to solve at the time; if you're doing onboarding, design experiments focused on onboarding. What's the most important information you should look at right now? It's very easy to do a bunch of UX research that's simply not applicable to the product design problems of the moment, and it's simply going to get tossed.

_How do you get data that won't be tossed?_

Brynn: We have research involved in the whole process. No matter if you're a startup or a big company like Google, doing research at inappropriate times makes it useless. We still do research pretty regularly on an active project, generally 1-2 times a week. We still do holistic tests every couple of weeks, but they're generally not as useful as the immediate, specific tests where we can have actionable info the next day.

_Are there other streams of data that you use?_

Bradford: We also have analysis and vision: looking at other products out there, understanding how the market is evolving over time. There was a window when everyone was looking at tablets, but eventually it became clear that phone-sized devices were going to dominate. At that point it would have been good to analyze what's going on instead of just basing info on Techcrunch articles. If we're going to break something that's more or less a UI standard, we'd better (1) have a damn good reason to do it, and (2) only violate it in few specific areas of your product, not everywhere (which would make it confusing). Spend a lot of time distilling input so you don't end up thrashing around all over the place, building many-headed hydra products/frankenproducts.

David: A big inspiration for me (and a big part of our job as designers) is looking at things around us, people working around us. We can only design really well the things that we're familiar with, the things that are for us. I joined Prezi because I had a deep interest in presentations. We can make unexpected connections by looking around us and within us.

_What is "product sense" or "taste"?_

David: Design isn't really about taste -- beauty is about context and what you're trying to achieve, and involves a lot of logical decisions and processes.

Bradford: If you're trying to reach an optimum solution within a space of possibilities, instinct is good for cutting down the number of possibilities, seeing everything but using accumulated experience as a guide towards optimal solutions. If you get lots of negative feedback, it's an excellent sign; if you get no feedback, that means no one cares about your product. Let's aggregate all these rants and see what we can dig into. They're pissed because things are broken, but they're actually using it. When you develop your instincts in that regard, you can find solutions to things faster.

_If instincts can be learned in that way, what are things we can do to deliberately train our instincts?_

David: It's not something you have when you're born -- instinct for me is the shortcut, the first thing that comes to my mind based on experience and my failures in the past. You'll eventually see similar problems come back often. You continue to make mistakes, but if you continue learning from them your instincts will change too.

_At what times should you not care about data or instinct and just pick a color?_

Bradford: It's about the burden of proof and where it lies -- a lot of times, people try to use data to try to stonewall something. The key is how you invest time; do you want me to get the perfect information that proves whether this color is right, or should we step back and think about what we should be investing time on now? Everyone having their opinion and arguing based on that is a huge waste of time.

Brynn: At Google it's still a bit different from the companies who don't have UX titles. Having these categories puts the final responsibility on the shoulders of people in design, and when it comes to a design decision, the design lead has the final call. With that said, we always look at real data, get customer reports and talk to users all the time.

_Have you ever ignored the data?_

David: Data tells us when we have to change something, but it doesn't tell us how we have to change it.

Braden: Data that's harder to gather may be just as valuable. Oftentimes a single metric (e.g. CTR) is just a slice of reality, and you have to think about the things that may be harder to measure.

_How has design thinking changed over the years?_

Bradford: The craft of creative synthesis is getting more sophisticated over the years, as we're being influenced by startup thinking and data. Most people in the agency world haven't really seen much of this; they haven't had to own a design and its results. It's really important now for a senior designer to be able to do this stuff.

_How often is your intuition incorrect after looking at the data? How useful is it to look for others' intuition?_

Brynn: Be careful of the difference between opinion and intuition. Intuition is built with past experience; opinion can quickly change after being confronted with data.

_What would you recommend for making better decisions?_

David: Take a walk outside, don't rush your decisions.

Bradford: Always propose a design and send it out to review like engineers send out code reviews. Enumerate goals, inputs, and the design itself.

Brynn: Get out of the opinion space. When you have to make a decision and you don't know whether it should be A or B, it usually means you're not clear on what your goals are or what problem you're trying to sove.
